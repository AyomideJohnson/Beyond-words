Analyzing Job Announcements for Biased Language

The goal of this project is to investigate occupational segregation resulting from conscious and unconscious biases in the expectations of hiring managers. In particular, the student will use text mining methods to analyze key terms used in job opening announcements for NIST.

This will entail first creating a data set of historical job advertisements using the USAJOBS application programming interface (API) to compile role and desired qualification descriptions. The data will then be analyzed for indicators of employer or recruiter socio-economic bias in relation to specific jobs or industries where occupational composition or demographic concentration distributions are incongruent with equitable access to occupational opportunity or economic security.
